The purpose of the event planning app I created was to help users in effectively organizing and managing their events. Addressing common user needs, such as creating, editing, and viewing events, while maintaining an intuitive process was the goal. The app has features like a login system, tools for creating and editing events, and a dynamic display of events arranged by date in order to meet these demands. A user-friendly interface that included screens such as an add-event page, a home page for event overviews, and customizable settings was used to present all of these. Simplicity and accessibility were given top priority in the UI designs, guaranteeing that users could browse the app with ease and without feeling overwhelmed. A visually clean design, logical button placement, and clear labels made the app accessible to all users.

I used an organized approach to the app's coding, beginning with database setup and working my way up to feature development. In order to identify problems early, I focused on methods like regular testing and modular code. For instance, I was able to replicate user interactions and make sure the program functioned as intended by testing it using the Android Emulator. Along with identifying errors, this technique also pointed out areas that needed work, such as improving SMS notifications or the user interface flow. Overcoming challenges, such as putting permission-based features into place, called for creative thinking and problem-solving, which improved my skills. My ability to balance technical execution with user-centered design was particularly evident in the SMS notification feature, which stood out as a component where I showed a firm understanding of combining functionality with user demands.
